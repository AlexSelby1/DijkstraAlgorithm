Write a program to calculate all the shortest paths using Dijkstras Algorithm where the user inputs the starting vertex. Adjust the code to allow the user to enter also an end vertex, and return just the shortest path to that vertex from the start vertex. 
Use file operations to write each shortest path to a text file (one per line).
